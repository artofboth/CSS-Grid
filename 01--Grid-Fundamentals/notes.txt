CSS Grid Fundamentals

• The idea behind a div is to display any element in the page as a grid, and slice it into columns and rows, so you can place elements in any arbitrary location in the page. 

• This enables much better control over our layout without using all the hacks that we used to use to position stuff. 

• When you display grid a container, you make every direct child element of that container into a grid item. 

• You can then slice the grid into whatever number of columns and rows you want with various methods.
