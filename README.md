# CSS-Grid

After working as a visual artist in public spaces for a number of years I got back into my original creative profession (web design) that I hadn't touched for ages. Oh boy, how things have changed! Animations? Grids? Damn, I better get updated! 

Luckily there's a heap of good resources and this is one of them: you can access the course for free here: http://cssgrid.io
